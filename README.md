## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a stunning hotel website based on a beautiful UI design created by our design team. This website will show all features and services provided by the hotel.

After development, users should be able to:

\-    View the optimal layout for the site depending on their deviceâ€™s screen size

\-    See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

\-    Use a website that is bug-free.

\-    Be able to browse through the website and interact with it and access the online services provided by the hotel.



## Getting Started

 The major languages used in creating this website are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The website also uses Bootstrap and icons are gotten from Font Awesome.

A text editor is needed to code.

A browser is needed to test the website, and it can work well across all major browsers.

Each design was allocated to one group. The design for group 3 can be found [here]([**https://www.figma.com/file/B9XOfyQrCspmZZ5a0odJbr/HOTEL-WEBSITE-DESIGN?node-id=0%3A1**](https://www.figma.com/file/B9XOfyQrCspmZZ5a0odJbr/HOTEL-WEBSITE-DESIGN?node-id=0%3A1)).

#### Workflow

The team carefully analyzed the UI design and split it into four major sections; the frontpage, the facilities page, the rooms and rates page, and the contact us page.

The team members then chose different sections of the page to work on, while waiting for the repo link to be shared.

When the repo link was made available, the team members forked their repos, added their contributions, and made pull requests which were then reviewed by the group's lead and merged into the group's repo [branch](https://github.com/hng-teamfury-org/frontend/tree/master/Group3).

The group cleaned up the code and made necessary changes to come up with a satisfactory final product. The repo was later merged with the [main repo](https://github.com/hngi/fury-frontend).


## Uploading

The hotel websites would be uploaded to theme-selling directories for free. The proposed theme-selling directories are 

- [Theme Forest](http://themeforest.net) 
- [Templatic](https://templatic.com)
- [Flippa](https://flippa.com)

Suggestions of other directories can be made to @p_yn3 or @codessage on slack.

## Marketing Strategy

The goal of the marketing team is to increase the number of downloads across all directories to a minimum of 1000. Our target audience is anybody with access to the internet and the ultimate goal is to reach out to organizations in need of websites.

We intend to make use of social media platforms and digital marketers. The members of **team-fury** are expected to share the download links to all their social media platforms
